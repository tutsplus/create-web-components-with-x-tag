# [Create Web Components With X-Tag][published url]
## Instructor: [Dan Wellman][instructor url]


Web Components are a collection of four distinct technologies that come together to form a new way to package and reuse self-contained components built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The four technologies that together make up Web Components are: Templates, Custom Elements, the Shadow DOM, and HTML Imports. Web Components offer a future of true reuse and encapsulation on the web, but until the various specifications that make up web components are implemented universally by browser vendors, we're going to need to make use of polyfills.

In this Coffee Break Course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Dan Wellman will show you how to create Web Components with the X-Tag library. X-Tag is a small library, backed by Microsoft, that uses some of the same polyfills used by Google's Polymer framework to deliver a rich interface for rapid web component development. You'll learn how to make use of life-cycle events for a component, how to work with attributes, how to add methods, and how to handle events using X-Tag's simple API.
